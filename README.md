#### Notes
The step bar only updates according to step goal. If the goal is reached, the bar will reset and double the goal. 

This is reflected in the screen shot above. The true step goal is 10k, but since it has been reached the progress bar has reset starting from 10k. Motivation :D

#### TODO
 * Heart rate monitor
 * Add current step count #, or increments of 1k
 * Different color scheme .. Companion app
